## ðŸŒ± How to start this project

There are 2 ways to start:

a) Open this link in your browser with [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod): https://github.com/codespaces/new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/python-hello

b) You can clone this repository on your local computer:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-hello
```

### Steps

- If working locally, you should have python [installed](https://4geeks.com/how-to/how-to-install-python).

- You should open the terminal on the path of this template and run `$ python3 app.py`, if everything works correctly, it should show `Hello World` on the terminal.

- You can test your code by typing: `$ python3 test.py`.

ðŸ’¡ Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## About the project we are going to build

In this tutorial, we are going to be building a REST API that exposes 3 endpoints to the internet:

```txt
GET /todos
POST /todos
DELETE /todos/<int:position>
```

### GET /todos

Will return the list of all todos like this:

```javascript
[
    {
        "done": true,
        "label": "Sample Todo 1"
    },
    {
        "done": true,
        "label": "Sample Todo 2"
    }
]
```

### POST /todos

This will add a new todo to the list with the following request body:

```javascript
{
    "done": true,
    "label": "Sample Todo 1"
}
```

And return the updated list of todos.

### DELETE /todos/<int:position>

This will remove one todo, based on a given position in the todos list, at the end of the URL and return the updated list of todos.
